## General Information
When you launch the .exe the track presentation begins, and then it is your turn to play ! 
# "Racing" mode
For the "racing" mode you play as Bowser, to move you have to use the arrows, to use the rear camera you have to hold down the shift key, finally to use your "turbo" (be careful you only have a limited amount), you can hold down ctrl. 
# Mode "Demo"
By clicking on "vuePeach" in the checkbox, you have access to the demo, where the 4 computers are fighting each other, you don't need to press anything. 
# Mode "drift"
If you check the "drift" box you lose the grip of your vehicle, the collisions will be more elastic and the mini-game is more enjoyable to play, but it is less realistic.
